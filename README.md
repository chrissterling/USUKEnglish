# USUKEnglish
(Probably too) simple single class for converting US to UK English and vice versa.  Just needed something to quickly convert the American English output of a LLM into British English.  It retains any capitalisation and punctuation and should be quick enough for most uses.

## Usage

Copy the class file in, then just call the ConvertString method.

    LangUtils.USUKEnglish.ConvertAmericanToBritish("I like the color gray!");

## Dictionary

There will be some translations missing, so please insert as you find or just post a list and I'll include.
